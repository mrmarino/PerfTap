#Monitors the number of times per second that the Lazy Writer process moves

\SQLServer:Buffer Manager\Lazy writes/sec

#Monitors the number of dirty pages, per second, that are flushed to disk when

#may indicate insufficient memory or that the recovery interval is too high

#Tells, on average, how many seconds SQL Server expects a data page to stay in

#less effective use of memory) or, simply, a potential shortage of memory. 
\SQLServer:Buffer Manager\Page Life Expectancy

#Number of auto-parameterization attempts per second. Total should be the sum of

\SQLServer:SQL Statistics\Auto-Param Attempts/sec

#Number of batch requests received per second, and is a good general indicator 
#for the activity level of the SQL Server.  This counter is highly dependent on 
#the hardware and quality of code running on the server. The more powerful the 
#hardware, the higher this number can be, even on poorly coded applications.  A 
#value of 1000 batch requests/sec is easily attainable though a typical 100Mbs 
#NIC can only handle about 3000 batch requests/sec.Many other counter thresholds 
#depend upon batch requests/sec while, in some cases, a low (or high) number 
#does not point to poor processing power.  You should frequently use this counter
#in combination with other counters, such as processor utilization or user 
#connections.In version 2000, “Transactions/sec” was the counter most often 
#used to measure overall activity, while versions 2005 and later use 
#“Batch Requests/sec”.  Versions 2005 prior to SP2, measure this counter 
#differently and may lead to some misunderstandings
#SQL Batch/sec > 10K is a client application warning, along with high CPU
#on individual CPU with high kernel time.
\SQLServer:SQL Statistics\Batch Requests/sec

#Number of times that Transact-SQL compilations occurred, per second (including
#recompiles). The lower this value is the better.  High values often indicate 
#excessive adhoc querying and should be as low as possible. If excessive adhoc 
#querying is happening, try rewriting the queries as procedures or invoke the 
#queries using sp_executeSQL. When rewriting isn’t possible, consider using a 
#plan guide or setting the database to parameterization forced mode.
#<2/sec negligible, 2-20/sec could be investigated, 20-100 poor, >100 potentially serious, 
#keep in mind, a simple statement compile cost is low, a complex query could take 1min to compile.
\SQLServer:SQL Statistics\SQL Compilations/sec

#Number of times, per second, that Transact-SQL objects attempted to be executed 
#but had to be recompiled before completion.  This number should be at or near 
#zero, since recompiles can cause deadlocks and exclusive compile locks.  
#This counter’s value should follow in proportion to “Batch Requests/sec” and 
#“SQL Compilations/sec”.  This needs to be nil in your system as much as possible.
\SQLServer:SQL Statistics\SQL Re-Compilations/sec

#Number of cancels and query timeouts occurring per second.  This number should

#The number of user logins per second. Any value over 2 may indicate insufficient

#High logout rate is bad because true logins are expensive. 
#The login counter includes both true logins and connection pooling logins.
\SQLServer:General Statistics\Logins/sec
\SQLServer:General Statistics\Logouts/sec

#The number of users currently connected to the SQL Server.  This counter should 
#roughly track with “Batch Requests/Sec”.  They should generally rise and fall 
#together.  For example, blocking problems could be revealed by rising user 
#connections, lock waits and lock wait time coupled with declining batch 
#requests/sec.  
\SQLServer:General Statistics\User Connections

#The number of latches in the last second that had to wait. Latches are lightweight 
#means of holding a very transient server resource, such as an address in memory
\SQLServer:Latches\Latch Waits/sec

#The average latch wait time, in milliseconds, for any latch requests that had to 
#wait.  This value should generally correlate to “Latch Waits/sec” and move up 
#or down with it accordingly
\SQLServer:Latches\Average Latch Wait Time (ms)

#How many times users waited to acquire a lock over the past second.  Values 
#greater than zero indicate at least some blocking is occurring, while a 
#value of zero can quickly eliminate blocking as a potential root-cause 
#problem.  As with “Lock Wait Time”, lock waits are not recorded by PerfMon 
#until after the lock event completes. 
\SQLServer:Locks(*)\Lock Waits/sec

#The average wait time, in milliseconds, for each lock request that had to wait.  
#An average wait time longer than 500ms may indicate excessive blocking. This 
#value should generally correlate to “Lock Waits/sec” and move up or down with it 
#accordingly.
\SQLServer:Locks(*)\Average Wait Time (ms)

#The number of new locks and locks converted per second. This metric’s value 
#should generally correspond to “Batch Requests/sec”. Values > 1000 may indicate 
#queries are accessing very large numbers of rows and may benefit from tuning.
\SQLServer:Locks(*)\Lock Requests/sec

#Shows the number of lock requests per second that timed out, including internal 
#requests for NOWAIT locks. A value greater than zero might indicate that user 
#queries are not completing.  The lower this value is, the better.
\SQLServer:Locks(*)\Lock Timeouts/sec
\SQLServer:Locks(*)\Lock Timeouts (timeout > 0)/sec

# Number of lock requests, per second, which resulted in a deadlock.  Since only 
#a COMMIT, ROLLBACK, or deadlock can terminate a transaction (excluding failures 
#or errors), this is an important value to track.  Excessive deadlocking 
#indicates a table or index design error or bad application design
\SQLServer:Locks(*)\Number of Deadlocks/sec

#Percentage of work tables created whose initial two pages were immediately 
#available from the worktable cache. A value less than 90% may indicate

#on 32-bit systems, the need for an upgrade to a 64-bit system.
\SQLServer:Access Methods\Worktables From Cache Ratio

#Number of times that SQL Server escalated locks from page- or row-level to 
#table-level. This number should, generally, be low.  Frequent or even occasional 
#spiking in this value may indicate poorly coded transactions
\SQLServer:Access Methods\Table Lock Escalations/sec

#Long a stalwart counter used by SQL Server DBAs, this counter is no longer 
#very useful. It monitors the percentage of data requests answer from the buffer
#cache since the last reboot. However, other counters are much better for 
#showing current memory pressure that this one because it blows the curve. For 
#example, PLE (page life expectancy) might suddenly drop from 2000 to 70, while
#buffer cache hit ration moves only from 98.2 to 98.1. Only be concerned by this
#counter if it’s value is regularly below 90 (for OLTP) or 80 (for very large OLAP).
#\SQLServer:Buffer Manager\Buffer cache hit ratio

#The way in which Windows measures disk queues, combined with the amount of cache 
#that storage vendors provide with hard disk controllers, SANs, and hard disks 
#themselves means that Windows might perceive that data is written all the way 
#to disk, when in fact the data is actually sitting in a hardware-level cache somewhere.

#A highly misinterpret counter is network bandwidth %, few situations will
